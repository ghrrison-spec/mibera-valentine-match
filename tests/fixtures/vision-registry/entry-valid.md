## Insight

Configuration governance across model selection could use Ostrom-style polycentric governance. Rather than a single authority choosing models, let agents propose model configurations with evidence, and use consensus mechanisms to adopt changes.

## Potential

Could transform the model selection process from authoritarian to democratic, improving resilience and reducing single points of failure.
