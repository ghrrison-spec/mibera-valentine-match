    term: "Hounfour"
    short: "The temple where spirits are summoned — the model invocation pipeline"
    context: |
      Named after the Haitian Vodou temple, via Gibson's Count Zero (1986) where
      the hounfour is the space where AI-loa entities manifest. Gibson drew from
      Tallant and likely Deren's anthropological work. In Loa, the Hounfour is
      the abstraction layer that manages model invocation, routing, and orchestration.

  - id: loa
    term: "Loa"
    short: "Intermediary spirits via Gibson's Sprawl trilogy — the agent framework itself"
    context: |
      The naming draws from Haitian Vodou through Gibson's Sprawl trilogy. Gibson
      adapted Vodou via Tallant (1946) and likely Deren (1953). In Count Zero, AIs
      fragment into loa — "appropriate interfaces with mankind." The framework
      serves as intermediary between human intent and machine execution.
