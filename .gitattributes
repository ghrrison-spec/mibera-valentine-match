# Loa Framework Git Attributes
# These settings ensure smooth updates from upstream without overwriting project files

# =============================================================================
# PROJECT IDENTITY FILES
# =============================================================================
# These files define YOUR project, not the Loa framework.
# Using merge=ours ensures your versions are preserved during `git merge loa/main`
#
# IMPORTANT: For this to work, downstream projects must configure the merge driver:
#   git config merge.ours.driver true
#
# This is a one-time setup that tells Git to always keep the local version
# when merging these files from upstream.

README.md merge=ours
CHANGELOG.md merge=ours

# =============================================================================
# CI/CD WORKFLOW FILES
# =============================================================================
# GitHub Actions workflow files require the `workflow` OAuth scope to push.
# Downstream projects should not receive upstream workflow changes via
# `git merge loa/main` — this blocks pushes for users without that scope.
# Using merge=ours ensures downstream workflow files are preserved.
# For NEW workflow files added upstream, /update-loa includes a post-merge
# revert step (Phase 5.5) to remove them.

.github/workflows/*.yml merge=ours
.github/workflows/*.yaml merge=ours

# =============================================================================
# LINE ENDING NORMALIZATION
# =============================================================================
# Ensure consistent line endings across platforms

* text=auto

# Shell scripts should always have LF endings
*.sh text eol=lf

# Batch files should have CRLF on Windows
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf

# =============================================================================
# BINARY FILES
# =============================================================================
# Treat these as binary (no diff, no merge)

*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
*.pdf binary
*.zip binary
*.tar.gz binary
*.woff binary
*.woff2 binary

# =============================================================================
# DIFF SETTINGS
# =============================================================================
# Use appropriate diff drivers for better diffs
