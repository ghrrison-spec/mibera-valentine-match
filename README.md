> *"The Loa are pragmatic entities... They're not worshipped for salvation—they're worked with for practical results."*

## What Is This?

Loa is an agent-driven development framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) (Anthropic's official CLI). It adds 17 specialized AI agents, quality gates, persistent memory, and structured workflows on top of Claude Code. Works on macOS and Linux. Created by [@janitooor](https://github.com/janitooor) at [The Honey Jar](https://0xhoneyjar.xyz).

### Why "Loa"?

In William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy (*Neuromancer*, *Count Zero*), Loa are AI entities that "ride" humans through neural interfaces — a metaphor Gibson adapted from Haitian Vodou via the anthropological work of Robert Tallant and (likely) Maya Deren. These agents don't replace you — they **ride with you**, channeling expertise through the interface. See [docs/ecosystem-architecture.md](docs/ecosystem-architecture.md#naming--the-scholarly-chain) for the full naming lineage.

## Quick Start (~2 minutes)

**Prerequisites**: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) (Anthropic's CLI for Claude), Git, jq, [yq v4+](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). See **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)** for full details.

```bash
# Install (one command, any existing repo — adds Loa as git submodule)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/main/.claude/scripts/mount-loa.sh | bash

# Or pin to a specific version
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/main/.claude/scripts/mount-loa.sh | bash -s -- --tag v1.39.0

# Start Claude Code
claude

# These are slash commands typed inside Claude Code, not your terminal.
# 5 commands. Full development cycle.
/plan      # Requirements -> Architecture -> Sprints
/build     # Implement the current sprint
/review    # Code review + security audit
/ship      # Deploy and archive
```

After install, you should see `.loa/` (submodule), `.claude/` (symlinks), `grimoires/loa/`, and `.loa.config.yaml` in your repo. Run `/loa doctor` inside Claude Code to verify everything is healthy.

> **Three ways to install**: Submodule mode (default, recommended for existing projects), clone template (new projects), or vendored mode (legacy — no symlink support). See **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#choosing-your-installation-method)** for the full comparison.

Not sure where you are? `/loa` shows your current state, health, and next step.

New project? See **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#method-2-clone-template)** to clone the template. For detailed setup, optional tools (beads, ck), and configuration, start there too.

## Why Loa?

**The problem**: AI coding assistants are powerful but unstructured. Without guardrails, you get ad-hoc code with no traceability, no security review, and no memory across sessions.

**The solution**: Loa adds structure without ceremony. Each phase produces a traceable artifact (PRD, SDD, Sprint Plan, Code, Review, Audit) using specialized AI agents. Your code gets reviewed by a Tech Lead agent *and* a Security Auditor agent before it ships.

**Key differentiators**:
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: 17 specialized skills, not one general-purpose prompt
- **Quality gates**: Two-phase review (code + security) prevents unreviewed code from shipping
- **Session persistence**: Beads task graph + persistent memory survive context clears
- **Adversarial review**: Flatline Protocol uses cross-model dissent (Opus + GPT-5.2) for planning QA
- **Zero-config start**: Mount onto any repo, type `/plan`, start building

## The Workflow

### Golden Path (5 commands, zero arguments)

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/loa` | Where am I? What's next? |
| `/plan` | Plan your project (requirements -> architecture -> sprints) |
| `/build` | Build the current sprint |
| `/review` | Review and audit your work |
| `/ship` | Deploy and archive |

Each Golden Path command auto-detects context and does the right thing. No arguments needed. First run of `/plan` takes 2-5 minutes and creates `grimoires/loa/prd.md`.

### Diagnostics

If something isn't working, start here:

```bash
/loa doctor          # Full system health check with structured error codes
/loa doctor --json   # CI-friendly output
```

### Power User Commands (Truenames)

For fine-grained control, use the underlying commands directly:

| Phase | Command | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | `/plan-and-analyze` | Product Requirements (PRD) |
| 2 | `/architect` | Software Design (SDD) |
| 3 | `/sprint-plan` | Sprint Plan |
| 4 | `/implement sprint-N` | Code + Tests |
| 5 | `/review-sprint sprint-N` | Approval or Feedback |
| 5.5 | `/audit-sprint sprint-N` | Security Approval |
| 6 | `/deploy-production` | Infrastructure |

**47 total commands.** Type `/loa` for the Golden Path or see [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) for all commands.

## The Agents

Seventeen specialized skills that ride alongside you:

| Skill | Role |
|-------|------|
| discovering-requirements | Senior Product Manager |
| designing-architecture | Software Architect |
| planning-sprints | Technical PM |
| implementing-tasks | Senior Engineer |

## Architecture

Loa uses a **three-zone model** inspired by AWS Projen and Google's ADK:

| Zone | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **System** | `.claude/` | Framework-managed (never edit directly) |
| **State** | `grimoires/`, `.beads/` | Project memory |
| **App** | `src/`, `lib/` | Your code |

**Key principle**: Customize via `.claude/overrides/` and `.loa.config.yaml`, not by editing `.claude/` directly.
