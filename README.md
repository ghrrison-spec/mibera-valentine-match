> *"The Loa are pragmatic entities... They're not worshipped for salvation—they're worked with for practical results."*

**Run Mode AI** — Agent-driven development framework using 9 specialized AI agents to orchestrate the complete product lifecycle. From requirements through production deployment.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-liner install onto any repo
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/main/.claude/scripts/mount-loa.sh | bash

# Start Claude Code and begin
claude
/plan-and-analyze
```

See **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)** for detailed setup options and prerequisites.

## The Workflow

| Phase | Command | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | `/plan-and-analyze` | Product Requirements (PRD) |
| 2 | `/architect` | Software Design (SDD) |
| 3 | `/sprint-plan` | Sprint Plan |
| 4 | `/implement sprint-N` | Code + Tests |
| 5 | `/review-sprint sprint-N` | Approval or Feedback |
| 5.5 | `/audit-sprint sprint-N` | Security Approval |
| 6 | `/deploy-production` | Infrastructure |

**Ad-hoc**: `/audit`, `/translate`, `/validate`, `/compound`, `/feedback`, `/update-loa`, `/loa` (guided workflow)

See **[PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md)** for complete workflow documentation.

## The Agents

Nine specialized agents that ride alongside you:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| discovering-requirements | Senior Product Manager |
| designing-architecture | Software Architect |
| planning-sprints | Technical PM |
| implementing-tasks | Senior Engineer |
| reviewing-code | Tech Lead |
| auditing-security | Security Auditor |
| deploying-infrastructure | DevOps Architect |
| translating-for-executives | Developer Relations |
| run-mode | Autonomous Executor |

## Architecture

Loa uses a **three-zone model** inspired by AWS Projen and Google's ADK:

| Zone | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **System** | `.claude/` | Framework-managed (never edit directly) |
| **State** | `grimoires/`, `.beads/` | Project memory |
| **App** | `src/`, `lib/` | Your code |

**Key principle**: Customize via `.claude/overrides/` and `.loa.config.yaml`, not by editing `.claude/` directly.

## Why "Loa"?

In William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy, Loa are AI entities that "ride" humans through neural interfaces. These agents don't replace you—they **ride with you**, channeling expertise through the interface.
