# Security Updates:
# - Dependabot will automatically create PRs for security updates regardless of schedule
# - Security updates are prioritized and opened immediately when detected
# - Critical vulnerabilities will open PRs even if open-pull-requests-limit is reached
#
# To customize for your team:
# 1. Replace "your-team" with your GitHub team name or individual usernames
# 2. Adjust schedule timing to match your team's workflow
# 3. Add assignees if you want automatic PR assignments
# 4. Configure ignore rules if specific packages should not be updated
#
# Example ignore configuration (add to any update block):
# ignore:
#   - dependency-name: "package-name"
#     versions: ["1.x", "2.x"]
#   - dependency-name: "another-package"
#     update-types: ["version-update:semver-major"]
