## Insight

Agent orchestration mastery follows a learning curve analogous to RTS games. The framework should scale friction to the operator's position on that curve: beginners get guardrails on agent count and depth gates proposing research plans, while power users get rapid-deploy with precision at scale and minimal friction.

Key design principles: persona + scope (both archetype lens AND clear boundaries), depth gates (propose known/unknown/recommend before next swarm), RuneScape Wilderness model (show risk warning once then trust the player), and token visibility (expose per-agent token counts to orchestrator).

## Potential

Progressive disclosure prevents beginners from burning tokens on poorly-scoped swarms while letting power users operate at full speed. The framework should model operator trust level and adjust intervention frequency accordingly.
