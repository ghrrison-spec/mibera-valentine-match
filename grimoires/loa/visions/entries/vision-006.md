## Insight

There is a missing layer between adversarial review (Flatline) and implementation (Run Mode). The symbiotic layer would track operator's clarity state (fuzzy to sharp) across a session, detect when intent crystallizes and match agent precision accordingly, reduce translation loss between what the operator means and what agents do, and know when to deploy Flatline (artifact exists) vs when to co-think (vision forming).

Key distinction: "Rip this apart" triggers Flatline council. "Help me think" triggers Symbiotic mode. These are fundamentally different interaction patterns.

## Potential

The success metric isn't "did the agent understand?" but "did the receiver understand what the sender meant, through the tool?" Extends beyond operator-to-agent to team-scale mind-to-mind cognitive style bridging.
