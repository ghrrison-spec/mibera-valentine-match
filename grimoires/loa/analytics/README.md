# Analytics (`analytics/`)

This directory contains usage tracking data for THJ developers.

## Purpose

Analytics files track:

- Command usage patterns
- Agent execution metrics
- Session statistics

## Files

- `usage.json` - Aggregated usage statistics
- `pending-feedback.json` - Feedback awaiting submission to GitHub (temporary)
- `HELPER-PATTERNS.md` - Documented patterns for common workflows

## Privacy

- **OSS users**: No analytics tracking occurs
- **THJ developers**: Opt-in sharing via `/feedback` command

## Note for Template Users

This directory is intentionally empty in the template. Analytics are developer-specific and excluded from version control.
