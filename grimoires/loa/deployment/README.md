# Deployment Artifacts (`deployment/`)

This directory contains infrastructure and deployment documentation generated by the DevOps agent.

## Purpose

When you run `/deploy-production`, the deploying-infrastructure agent generates:

- **Deployment checklists** for production releases
- **Migration guides** for breaking changes
- **Release notes** for stakeholder communication
- **Infrastructure audits** (excluded from git for security)

## Generated Files

Files in this directory are project-specific and generated during deployment:

- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_*.md` - Step-by-step deployment procedures
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE_*.md` - Database/API migration instructions
- `RELEASE_NOTES_*.md` - User-facing change documentation
- `SERVER-REALITY-AUDIT.md` - Server configuration audit (gitignored)

## Security Note

`SERVER-REALITY-AUDIT.md` contains sensitive server configuration details and is always excluded from version control, even if you uncomment other exclusions.

## Note for Template Users

This directory is intentionally empty in the template. Deployment artifacts are generated when you run Loa deployment commands on your project.
