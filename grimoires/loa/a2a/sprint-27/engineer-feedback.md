# Engineer Feedback: Sprint 3 — Bridge Iteration 1

All good

All three Bridgebuilder findings addressed:
- BB-medium-1: Idempotent guard pattern correctly implemented with `_CLASSIFICATION_CACHE_LOADED` boolean
- BB-low-2: Test summary now distinguishes tests (12) from assertions (17)
- All four test suites pass with zero failures
