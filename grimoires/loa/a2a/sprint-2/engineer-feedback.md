# Engineer Feedback: Sprint 2

> **Sprint:** sprint-2 (global ID: 2)
> **Reviewer:** Senior Technical Lead
> **Date:** 2026-02-14
> **Verdict:** All good

## Summary

All 4 tasks complete. Clean frontend implementation with zero dependencies, proper XSS protection via DOM-based escapeHTML, graceful image fallback handling, and responsive layout at 768px/480px breakpoints. Gothic cathedral canvas background is static (zero CPU cost). Design evolved from "neon rave" to "gothic crimson" per user direction.

## Noted Deviations (Acceptable)

1. **Design aesthetic**: Shifted from neon rave (SDD) to gothic crimson + Valentine per iterative user feedback
2. **Layout restructured**: Portrait-row (images + heart) / info-row (traits) replaces card-based layout from SDD
3. **Canvas background**: Added gothic architecture + cultist pyramids (user-directed, not in original SDD)
4. **Implementation report**: Located at `a2a/sprint-1/reviewer-sprint2.md` rather than `a2a/sprint-2/`
