# Canonical URL Registry

# See: .claude/protocols/url-registry.md

environments:
  production:
    base: ""        # e.g., https://myapp.com
    api: ""         # e.g., https://api.myapp.com

    base: ""        # e.g., https://staging.myapp.com
  local:
    base: http://localhost:3000
    api: http://localhost:3000/api
