  short: >-
    Access to scarce resources governed through multi-perspective evaluation
    with fail-closed semantics. Appears identically in Flatline (model consensus),
    Red Team (attack/defense), and HoneyJar vault governance (on-chain multisig).
  context: >-
    The review pipeline and the vault share an identical governance shape:
    multiple independent evaluators must reach consensus before state changes
    are permitted, with the default being rejection. In Flatline, two+ models
    must agree before findings auto-integrate. In Red Team, attacker and
    defender perspectives must both be satisfied. In HoneyJar vaults,
    multi-sig holders must agree before funds move. This is not coincidence —
    it is the same pattern applied at different scales. The insight enables
    cross-pollination: security review patterns from code review can inform
    on-chain governance design, and vice versa. Elinor Ostrom's commons
    governance principles (graduated sanctions, collective-choice arrangements)
    describe why this pattern works across domains. The Condorcet jury theorem
    provides the mathematical foundation — when individual evaluators are
    better than random, majority voting accuracy approaches 1 as group size
    grows. Google's Tricorder cascading (ISSTA 2018) demonstrates the same
    principle at scale: composable analysis passes where later stages condition
    on earlier findings.

  short: >-
    Later review stages condition on earlier findings, transforming sequential
    evaluation into structured deliberation where each voice builds on prior voices.
  context: >-
    The Red Team code-vs-design gate was designed as a compliance check, but when
    its findings feed into the Bridgebuilder review as prior context, it becomes
    the first voice in a structured deliberation. The Condorcet jury theorem
    provides the mathematical basis — independent evaluators with better-than-random
    accuracy produce majority decisions approaching certainty. Google's Tricorder
    system (ISSTA 2018) implements this at scale: composable analysis passes where
    findings cascade through stages. In jazz, this is the ensemble where each
    instrument responds to what came before — not unison, but structured
    improvisation. The bridge review pipeline naturally evolves toward this shape
    as more review capabilities are added. Web4 insight from cycle-046 deep review:
    "findings must be scarce but perspectives can be infinite" — the deliberative
    council maximizes perspective diversity while maintaining finding scarcity
    through consensus thresholds.
