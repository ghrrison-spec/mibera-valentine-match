# Research (`research/`)

This directory contains research artifacts and discovery notes generated during project development.

## Purpose

Research files capture:

- **Domain research** - Industry analysis, competitor review
- **Technical spikes** - Proof-of-concept investigations
- **Naming explorations** - Terminology and branding research
- **Discovery artifacts** - Notes from `/plan-and-analyze` deep dives

## Usage

Files here are typically created:

- During the discovery phase (`/plan-and-analyze`)
- When investigating technical approaches
- When exploring naming/branding options

## Note for Template Users

This directory is intentionally empty in the template. Research files are project-specific and generated during your discovery process.
