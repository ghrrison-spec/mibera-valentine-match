## Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities (DoS)

### Arrow Function Closure Memory Leak (HIGH)

**CWE**: CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime)

**Impact**: Memory exhaustion leading to service denial. Can accumulate 1GB+ memory in long-running processes.

**Vulnerable Pattern**:
```javascript
// Arrow function captures entire surrounding scope
signal.addEventListener('abort', () => controller.abort());
const timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), ms);
```

**Attack Vector**: In long-running services or sessions, each arrow function retains references to large objects (request bodies, response data, options objects), preventing garbage collection.

**Secure Pattern**:
```javascript
// .bind() only retains reference to the controller object
const abort = controller.abort.bind(controller);
signal.addEventListener('abort', abort, { once: true });
const timeout = setTimeout(abort, ms);
```

**Detection**:
- Flag `addEventListener` with arrow function calling `obj.method()`
- Flag `setTimeout`/`setInterval` with arrow function calling `obj.method()`
- Especially in request handlers, middleware, or long-lived processes

**Audit Template**:
```
SEVERITY: HIGH
CATEGORY: Resource Exhaustion (DoS)
CWE: CWE-401
LOCATION: {file}:{line}
FINDING: Arrow function closure captures scope preventing GC
FIX: Replace `() => obj.method()` with `obj.method.bind(obj)`
```

**Reference**: Claude Code memory optimization (2026)

## Parallel Audit Guidelines

### When to Split
| Size | Lines | Strategy |
|------|-------|----------|
| SMALL | <2,000 | Sequential |
| MEDIUM | 2,000-5,000 | Consider splitting |
| LARGE | >5,000 | MUST split |

### Category Assignment
- Security: auth/, api/, middleware/, config/
- Architecture: src/, infrastructure/
- Code Quality: src/, tests/
- DevOps: Dockerfile, terraform/, .github/
- Blockchain: contracts/, wallet/, web3/

### Consolidation
1. Collect all findings
2. Deduplicate overlaps
3. Sort by severity
4. Calculate overall risk
5. Generate unified report

## SAST Detection Patterns (Two-Pass Methodology v1.0)

**⚠️ Language Scope**: These patterns are optimized for JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js. For other languages, extend patterns in `.claude/overrides/security-patterns/`.

### SQL Injection (CWE-89)

```regex
# String concatenation with user input
query\s*\(\s*[`'"].*\$\{|query\s*\+\s*.*req\.|execute\s*\(\s*f['"]

# Template literals in queries
`SELECT.*\$\{.*\}`

# ORM raw modes (still dangerous)
\.raw\s*\(|\.literal\s*\(|QueryRaw
```

**Known False Positives**: Static strings, parameterized queries via ORM.
**Required Sanitization**: Parameterized queries, ORM bindings (not `.raw()`).

### Command Injection (CWE-78)

```regex
# Shell execution with variables
exec\s*\(.*\$|system\s*\(.*\+|spawn\s*\([^,]+,\s*\[.*\$

# Child process with user input
child_process.*req\.|execSync.*\$\{

# Backtick command execution
`.*\$\{.*\}`\s*;?\s*$
```

**Known False Positives**: Hardcoded commands, allowlisted arguments.
**Required Sanitization**: Allowlist validation, `shlex.quote()`, avoid shell=true.

### XSS (CWE-79)

```regex
# Direct HTML assignment
innerHTML\s*=.*req\.|\.html\s*\(.*req\.|dangerouslySetInnerHTML

# Template rendering with user data
render\s*\(.*req\.|ejs\.render.*req\.|handlebars\.compile.*\$\{

# jQuery html injection
\$\(.*\)\.html\s*\(.*req\.
```

**Known False Positives**: Sanitized output via DOMPurify, framework auto-escaping.
**Required Sanitization**: HTML encoding, CSP headers, DOMPurify.

### Path Traversal (CWE-22)

```regex
# File operations with user input
readFile.*req\.|writeFile.*req\.|path\.join.*req\.

# Path construction from user data
__dirname.*\+.*req\.|path\.resolve.*req\.

# File system access patterns
fs\.(read|write|unlink|mkdir).*\$\{
```

**Known False Positives**: Validated/normalized paths, chroot jails.
**Required Sanitization**: Path normalization, basename extraction, chroot.

### SSRF (CWE-918)

```regex
# HTTP requests with user-controlled URLs
fetch\s*\(.*req\.|axios\s*\(.*req\.|http\.get\s*\(.*req\.

# URL construction from user input
new URL\s*\(.*req\.|url\.parse\s*\(.*req\.
```

**Known False Positives**: Allowlisted URLs, internal service calls.
**Required Sanitization**: URL allowlist, DNS rebinding protection.

### Prompt Injection (LLM-Specific)

```regex
# User input concatenated into prompts
prompt.*\+.*user|`.*\$\{user.*\}.*`.*chat|system:.*\$\{

# Template strings with user content in LLM context
messages\.push.*content.*req\.|completion.*prompt.*\$\{
```

**Known False Positives**: Properly sanitized/filtered user content.
**Required Sanitization**: Input filtering, output validation, guardrails.

## LLM Safety Checks

**When to Apply**: If codebase contains AI/LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

| Check | What to Look For | Severity | CWE |
|-------|------------------|----------|-----|
| **Prompt Injection** | User input concatenated into prompts | HIGH | CWE-94 |
| **Model Output Trust** | LLM responses used without validation | MEDIUM | CWE-20 |
| **System Prompt Leakage** | Error messages exposing system prompts | MEDIUM | CWE-209 |
| **Indirect Injection** | Documents/URLs processed by LLM | HIGH | CWE-94 |
| **Data Exfiltration** | User data sent to external LLM APIs | HIGH | CWE-200 |
| **Tool Abuse** | LLM controlling dangerous tools without bounds | CRITICAL | CWE-862 |

### LLM Detection Patterns

```regex
# Unsafe tool execution (LLM output → exec/eval)
eval\s*\(\s*.*response|exec\s*\(\s*.*completion|Function\s*\(.*llm

# Unbounded tool access
tools\s*=\s*\[.*exec|functions\s*:.*\{.*system

# Direct prompt construction
system_prompt.*=.*\+|messages\[0\]\.content.*req\.
```

### LLM Audit Checklist

- [ ] Is user input filtered before inclusion in prompts?
- [ ] Are LLM outputs validated before use in sensitive operations?
- [ ] Are tool calls bounded (allowlist, rate limits)?
- [ ] Is system prompt protected from extraction?
- [ ] Are documents/URLs sanitized before LLM processing?
- [ ] Is PII filtered before sending to external LLM APIs?
- [ ] Are LLM errors handled without leaking context?
