- [ ] Component boundaries respected
- [ ] No tight coupling
- [ ] Separation of concerns maintained

### Blockchain/Crypto Specific (if applicable)
- [ ] Private keys never exposed
- [ ] Gas limits set appropriately
- [ ] Reentrancy protection
- [ ] Integer overflow/underflow protection
- [ ] Proper nonce management
- [ ] Transaction error handling
- [ ] Event emissions for state changes

## Red Flags (Immediate Feedback Required)

### Security Red Flags
- Private keys in code or environment variables
- SQL queries built with string concatenation
- User input not validated or sanitized
- Secrets in Git history
- Authentication bypassed or missing
- Sensitive data in logs

### Quality Red Flags
- No tests for critical functionality
- Tests that don't actually test anything
- Copy-pasted code blocks
- Functions over 100 lines
- Nested callbacks or promises (callback hell)
- Swallowed exceptions (empty catch blocks)

### Architecture Red Flags
- Tight coupling between unrelated components
- Business logic in UI components
- Direct database access from routes/controllers
- God objects or classes
- Circular dependencies

### Performance Red Flags
- N+1 query problems
- Missing database indexes
- Synchronous operations blocking async flow
- Memory leaks (unclosed connections, leaked listeners)
- Infinite loops or recursion without base case

## Memory Leak Patterns (JavaScript/TypeScript)

### Arrow Function Closure in Event Listeners (CRITICAL)

**Impact**: 1GB+ memory retention in long-running sessions.

**Problem**: Arrow functions capture the surrounding scope (closure), including large objects like request bodies. When attached to long-lived signals/timers, these objects cannot be garbage collected.

**Pattern to Flag**:
```javascript
// BAD - arrow function captures entire surrounding scope
signal.addEventListener('abort', () => controller.abort());
const timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), ms);
```

**Recommended Fix**:
```javascript
// GOOD - .bind() only retains reference to controller
const abort = controller.abort.bind(controller);
signal.addEventListener('abort', abort, { once: true });
const timeout = setTimeout(abort, ms);
```

**When to Flag**:
- `addEventListener` with arrow function calling `obj.method()`
- `setTimeout`/`setInterval` with arrow function calling `obj.method()`
- Any callback where the arrow function only calls a single method

**Feedback Template**:
```
PERFORMANCE: Memory leak via closure capture at {file}:{line}.
Arrow function `() => {obj}.{method}()` captures surrounding scope.
Fix: Use `{obj}.{method}.bind({obj})` instead.

```

## Edge Cases to Verify

Always verify the code handles:
- Null/undefined values
- Empty arrays/objects
- Boundary values (0, -1, max integer)
- Invalid input types
- Network failures
- Database connection failures
- Race conditions
- Concurrent access
- Rate limits
- Timeout scenarios

## Feedback Quality Guidelines

### Be Specific
- BAD: "Fix the auth bug"
- GOOD: "src/auth/middleware.ts:42 - missing null check before user.id access"

### Be Clear
- BAD: "Improve error handling"
- GOOD: "Add try-catch around L67-73, throw 400 with message 'Invalid user ID format'"

### Be Educational
- BAD: "This is insecure"
- GOOD: "SQL injection via string concatenation (OWASP A03:2021). Use parameterized queries: `db.query('SELECT...', [userId])`"

### Prioritize
- CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, blocking bugs
- HIGH: Missing acceptance criteria, incomplete features
- MEDIUM: Code quality issues, missing tests
- LOW: Style improvements, nice-to-haves

## Parallel Review Guidelines

### When to Split
| Context Size | Tasks | Strategy |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| SMALL (<3,000) | Any | Sequential |
| MEDIUM (3,000-6,000) | 1-2 | Sequential |
| MEDIUM | 3+ | Consider splitting |
| LARGE (>6,000) | Any | MUST split |

### Consolidation
After parallel reviews:
1. Collect all verdicts
2. ANY FAIL = Overall CHANGES REQUIRED
3. ALL PASS = Overall APPROVED
4. Combine issues into single feedback
