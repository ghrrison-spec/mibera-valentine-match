|----------|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| drift-analysis.md | {N} | {N} | {N} | {X}% |
| governance-assessment.md | {N} | {N} | {N} | {X}% |
| consistency-analysis.md | {N} | {N} | {N} | {X}% |

## Health Score Verification

### Formula Used

```
HEALTH = (100 - drift%) x 0.50 + (consistency x 10) x 0.30 + (100 - hygiene x 5) x 0.20
```

### Calculation

| Component | Value | Weight | Contribution | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Drift | {drift}% | 50% | (100-{drift}) x 0.5 = {N} | drift-report.md:L1 |
| Consistency | {consistency}/10 | 30% | ({consistency} x 10) x 0.3 = {N} | consistency-report.md:L{N} |
| Hygiene | {hygiene} items | 20% | (100 - {hygiene} x 5) x 0.2 = {N} | hygiene-report.md |
| **TOTAL** | | **100%** | **{SCORE}** | calculated |

### Verification

- [ ] Formula matches official specification
- [ ] All input values sourced with (file:L##)
- [ ] Calculation mathematically correct
- [ ] Result within valid range (0-100)

## Assumptions Requiring Validation

| # | Assumption | Location | Validator | Priority |
|---|------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | {text} | {file}:L{N} | {Role} | {H/M/L} |
| 2 | {text} | {file}:L{N} | {Role} | {H/M/L} |

### Validation Protocol

For each assumption:
1. Identify subject matter expert (Validator column)
2. Schedule 15-min validation session
3. Update translation with grounded evidence
4. Re-run audit after validation

## Beads Suggested

| Issue | Priority | Labels | Source |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Strategic Liability: {issue} | P1 | strategic-liability,from-ride | hygiene-report.md:L{N} |

### beads_rust Issue Creation Commands

```bash
ISSUE_ID=$(br create "{Issue Title}" --priority {priority} --json | jq -r '.id')
br label add "$ISSUE_ID" strategic-liability
br label add "$ISSUE_ID" from-ride
br label add "$ISSUE_ID" requires-decision
br comments add "$ISSUE_ID" "Source: {file}:L{N}"
```
