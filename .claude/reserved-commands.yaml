# Claude Code Reserved Commands Registry
#
# This file lists all Claude Code built-in commands to prevent namespace conflicts
# with Loa custom commands. Do not add Loa commands to this list.
#
# IMPORTANT: Loa commands MUST NOT use these names. The validation script
# (.claude/scripts/validate-commands.sh) enforces this at CI time.

# Naming conventions for Loa commands to avoid conflicts
naming_guidelines:
  description: "Guidelines for naming Loa commands to prevent future conflicts"
  rules:
    - "Use descriptive, domain-specific names (e.g., /sprint-plan, /architect)"
    - "For generic functionality, add -loa suffix (e.g., /update-loa, /mcp-config)"
    - "Prefer multi-word commands with hyphens over single words"
    - "Never use single-character commands (reserved for Claude Code)"
    - "Check this registry before adding new commands"
    - "When in doubt, use a more specific name or add -loa suffix"

# Conflict resolution
conflict_resolution:
  strategy: "auto-rename"
  suffix: "-loa"
  examples:
    - conflict: "config"
      resolution: "mcp-config"
      reason: "More specific name better describes functionality"
    - conflict: "review"
      resolution: "review-sprint"
      reason: "Loa already uses review-sprint (no conflict)"
    - conflict: "update"
      resolution: "update-loa"
      reason: "Reserved for potential Claude Code update functionality"

# Maintenance
maintenance:
  check_frequency: "On every /update-loa"
  validation_script: ".claude/scripts/validate-commands.sh"
  update_process: "Monitor Claude Code release notes for new built-in commands"

# Enforcement
enforcement:
  enabled: true
  mode: "strict"  # strict = fail CI, warn = log warning only
  ci_integration: ".claude/scripts/validate-commands.sh"
  pre_commit_hook: false  # Set to true to enable pre-commit validation
