description: "Reusable library with public API, documentation, and versioning"
tags: ["library", "package", "api"]
context:
  vision: |
    A well-documented, reusable library with a stable public API.
  technical:
    - "Clear public API with minimal surface area"
    - "Semantic versioning with changelog"
    - "Type definitions / type annotations"
    - "Zero or minimal runtime dependencies"
    - "Tree-shakeable / modular exports"
  non_functional:
    - "Bundle size < 50KB minified (if JS/TS)"
    - "No side effects on import"
    - "Compatible with major runtimes (Node, Deno, browser)"
    - "API documentation generated from source"
  testing:
    - "Unit tests for all public API methods"
    - "Edge case and error path coverage"
    - "Compatibility tests across target runtimes"
  risks:
    - "Breaking changes without major version bump"
    - "Prototype pollution (if JS)"
    - "Dependency supply chain attacks"
