context:
  vision: |
    A full-stack web application with modern frontend and robust backend.
  technical:
    - "Frontend: component-based UI with state management"
    - "Backend: API layer with authentication middleware"
    - "Database: ORM/query builder with migrations"
    - "Shared types between frontend and backend"
    - "Environment-based configuration (dev, staging, prod)"
  non_functional:
    - "First contentful paint < 1.5s"
    - "API response time < 200ms p95"
    - "Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)"
    - "Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"
  testing:
    - "Component tests for UI elements"
    - "API integration tests"
    - "End-to-end tests for critical user flows"
  risks:
    - "XSS through unsanitized user content"
    - "CSRF on state-changing endpoints"
    - "Insecure direct object references (IDOR)"
