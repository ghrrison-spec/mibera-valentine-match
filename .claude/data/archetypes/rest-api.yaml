context:
  vision: |
    A RESTful API service following industry best practices.
  technical:
    - "RESTful API design with versioned endpoints (/api/v1/...)"
    - "Authentication (JWT or session-based) with refresh tokens"
    - "Input validation at API boundaries"
    - "OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generated from code"
    - "Database migrations with rollback support"
  non_functional:
    - "Response time < 200ms p95 for read operations"
    - "Rate limiting per API key"
    - "CORS configuration for frontend origins"
    - "Structured JSON logging with request tracing"
  testing:
    - "Integration tests for all endpoints"
    - "Auth flow tests (login, refresh, revoke)"
    - "Error response format validation"
  risks:
    - "SQL injection via unvalidated query parameters"
    - "Broken authentication (OWASP A07:2021)"
    - "Mass assignment vulnerabilities"
