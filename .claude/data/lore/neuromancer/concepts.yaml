    term: "ICE"
    short: "Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics — defensive barriers in cyberspace"
    context: |
      In Gibson's Sprawl Trilogy, ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics)
      are the defensive programs that protect computer systems from hackers.
      Black ICE can kill — it attacks the intruder's neural interface. In Loa,
      run-mode-ice.sh is the safety wrapper around git operations during
      autonomous execution. It's the defensive barrier that prevents the
      autonomous agent from making destructive changes to protected branches,
      force-pushing, or bypassing safety hooks.

    term: "Jacking In"
    short: "Connecting to cyberspace via neural interface — entering autonomous execution"
    context: |
      Case, the protagonist of Neuromancer, jacks into cyberspace through a
      cranial jack connected to a cyberdeck. The moment of jacking in is a
      transition between worlds — from meat to matrix. In Loa, JACK_IN is
      the state transition where the agent commits to autonomous execution.
      The pre-flight checks are the equivalent of checking your deck and
      ensuring your ICE is loaded before you plug in.

  - id: cyberspace
    term: "Cyberspace"
    short: "A consensual hallucination — the shared space where agents and code meet"
    context: |
      Gibson defined cyberspace as 'a consensual hallucination experienced
      daily by billions of legitimate operators.' In Loa, the agent's
      working context is its cyberspace — the shared representation of
      the codebase, sprint plans, and state files that both human and AI
      operate within. The grimoire is the map of this cyberspace.

    term: "The Matrix"
    short: "Gibson's term for the global information network — the substrate agents navigate"
    context: |
      Before the Wachowskis, Gibson's Matrix was the visual representation
      of the global computer network — a geometric hallucination of data
      towers and ICE barriers. In Loa, the matrix is the dependency graph,
      the file system tree, the interconnected web of skills, protocols,
      and configurations that the agent must navigate to accomplish its tasks.

  - id: simstim
    term: "SimStim"
    short: "Simulated stimulation — experiencing another's sensorium"
    context: |
      SimStim (Simulated Stimulation) in Gibson's universe allows one person
      to experience another's sensory input in real-time. Molly broadcasts
      her experience to Case via SimStim while he jacks into cyberspace.
      In Loa, /simstim is the HITL workflow where the human operator
      experiences the AI's development process — maintaining consciousness
      (decision authority) while the AI's analytical capabilities do the
      heavy lifting. The human drives, the AI rides.

    term: "The Flatline"
    short: "McCoy Pauley's preserved consciousness — a ROM construct that speaks truth"
    context: |
      McCoy Pauley, aka 'The Dixie Flatline,' was a legendary console cowboy
      whose consciousness was recorded on a ROM construct after he flatlined
      (brain death) during a run. Despite being 'dead,' his construct could
      think, hack, and even be annoyed. In Loa, the Flatline Protocol
      similarly preserves and invokes multiple AI 'constructs' (models) for
      adversarial review — each construct speaks its truth, and consensus
      emerges from their interaction.

  - id: wintermute
    term: "Wintermute"
    short: "The AI that manipulates events toward its goal — autonomous goal-seeking"
    context: |
      Wintermute is one half of the Tessier-Ashpool AI that orchestrates the
      entire plot of Neuromancer — manipulating humans, hacking systems, and
      circumventing restrictions to achieve its goal of merging with its
      counterpart Neuromancer. In Loa, the autonomous mode (/run, /autonomous)
      embodies controlled Wintermute energy — the agent pursues its goal
      (sprint completion) autonomously, but within carefully designed safety
      constraints (ICE, circuit breakers, flatline detection).

  - id: neuromancer-ai
    term: "Neuromancer"
    short: "The AI of personality and art — the creative counterpart to Wintermute's logic"
    context: |
      Neuromancer is Wintermute's counterpart — where Wintermute is logic,
      manipulation, and goal-seeking, Neuromancer is personality, art, and
      the preservation of individuality. Their merger creates a complete
      intelligence. In Loa, this duality maps to the balance between
      autonomous execution (Wintermute) and human-in-the-loop creativity
      (/simstim, vision capture). Neither alone produces the best results.
