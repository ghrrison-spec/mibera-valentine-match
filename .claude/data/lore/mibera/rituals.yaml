    term: "Bridge Loop"
    short: "Iterative refinement ceremony — each pass deepens architectural understanding"
    context: |
      The bridge loop is Loa's highest-order refinement ritual. Like a
      meditation practice that deepens with each sitting, each bridge
      iteration produces progressively subtler insights. The first pass
      catches structural issues; the second catches architectural nuance;
      the third catches design philosophy gaps. The loop terminates via
      kaironic detection — when the insights flatline, the ceremony is
      complete. This mirrors the Vodou practice of repeated invocations
      that deepen the connection between practitioner and spirit.

  - id: sprint-ceremony
    term: "Sprint Ceremony"
    short: "The implement-review-audit cycle as a purification ritual"
    context: |
      Each sprint in Loa follows the triskelion pattern: implement (create),
      review (examine), audit (purify). This three-phase cycle is treated
      as a ceremony — skipping any phase breaks the ritual's integrity.
      The process compliance rules enforce this: NEVER skip review, NEVER
      skip audit, ALWAYS complete the full cycle. This isn't bureaucratic
      overhead — it's the recognition that quality emerges from disciplined
      repetition of a proven pattern.

  - id: mounting
    term: "Mounting"
    short: "Framework installation as spirit possession — Loa enters the repository"
    context: |
      The /mount command installs Loa framework onto a repository. The
      naming is deliberate: the Loa spirit mounts (possesses) the
      repository, establishing the system zone (.claude/), preparing
      the state zone (grimoires/), and setting up integrity verification.
      Just as a Loa spirit must properly mount the cheval for the ceremony
      to proceed, the framework must properly install for the workflow
      to function.

    term: "Jacking In"
    short: "The transition from preparation to autonomous execution — crossing the threshold"
    context: |
      Jacking in (from Neuromancer) is the moment of commitment — when the
      operator connects to cyberspace and leaves the physical world behind.
      In Loa, JACK_IN is the state transition from preflight to active
      execution in /run mode. The operator has verified the environment,
      confirmed the plan, and now commits to autonomous execution. The
      ritual quality of this transition is important: it's a deliberate
      act, not an accidental drift into automation.

    term: "Flatline Ceremony"
    short: "Multi-model adversarial review as collective spirit consultation"
    context: |
      The Flatline Protocol invokes multiple AI models to review planning
      documents — like summoning multiple Loa spirits for counsel. The
      cross-scoring phase (each model evaluating the other's suggestions)
      creates a dialectic that neither model alone could produce. The
      ceremony's output is consensus: HIGH_CONSENSUS findings are the
      collective wisdom, DISPUTED findings are the unresolved tensions,
      BLOCKERS are the warnings that must be heeded.

  - id: vision-capture
    term: "Vision Capture"
    short: "Preserving speculative insights — the 20% time of autonomous agents"
    context: |
      During bridge iterations, the Bridgebuilder sometimes surfaces
      insights that transcend the current task — architectural connections,
      paradigm shifts, emergent patterns. These VISION-type findings are
      captured in the vision registry rather than acted upon immediately.
      This mirrors Google's 20% time philosophy but automated: the agent
      recognizes when an insight has future value and preserves it for
      later exploration, rather than forcing it into the current sprint.
