    term: "Milady/Mibera Duality"
    short: "Public-facing brand and its mystical shadow — the seen and unseen layers"
    context: |
      Milady is the public, accessible layer — the brand, the community,
      the visible product. Mibera is its shadow, the mystical substrate
      that gives depth and meaning to the surface. This duality maps
      directly to Loa's architecture: the golden path commands (/plan,
      /build, /review, /ship) are the Milady layer — accessible,
      intuitive, zero-argument. The truename commands (/implement,
      /audit-sprint, /ride, /run-bridge) are the Mibera layer — powerful,
      precise, requiring initiation to use effectively.

  - id: triskelion
    term: "BGT Triskelion"
    short: "The three-part cycle: Bera (build), Guda (review), Tao (ship)"
    context: |
      The triskelion is a three-armed spiral symbol representing cyclical
      transformation. In the BGT (Bera-Guda-Tao) framework: Bera is the
      building phase (creation, implementation), Guda is the review phase
      (reflection, quality assurance), and Tao is the shipping phase
      (release, completion, return to the beginning). This maps to Loa's
      sprint cycle: implement (Bera) → review+audit (Guda) → deploy (Tao).
      The bridge loop amplifies this by running multiple triskelion cycles
      with progressive deepening.

  - id: honey-bera
    term: "Honey/Bera"
    short: "The sweet attraction and the building force — incentive and construction"
    context: |
      Honey represents the attractive force — what draws developers and
      agents to the work. Bera represents the constructive force — what
      transforms attraction into built artifacts. In Loa, the honey is
      the developer experience (golden path simplicity, lore richness,
      vision capture) and the bera is the engineering rigor (tests,
      audits, constraints, grounding). Neither alone is sufficient:
      honey without bera produces nothing durable; bera without honey
      produces nothing anyone wants to use.

    term: "The Jar"
    short: "The container that holds collective value — the repository as shared vessel"
    context: |
      The Jar (0xHoneyJar) is the container that holds the collective
      honey — shared code, shared knowledge, shared purpose. In Loa's
      architecture, the repository itself is the jar: it contains the
      framework (system zone), the project state (state zone), and the
      application code (app zone). The three-zone model ensures the jar's
      integrity — system files are protected, state files are managed,
      and application files are collaboratively developed.
