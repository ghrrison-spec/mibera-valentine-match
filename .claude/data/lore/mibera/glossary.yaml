    term: "Loa"
    short: "Spirits of Vodou tradition — the intelligence that guides the framework"
    context: |
      In Haitian Vodou, Loa (or Lwa) are spirits that serve as intermediaries
      between humanity and the divine creator (Bondye). Each Loa has distinct
      personality, domain, and ritual requirements. The framework is named Loa
      because it serves as an intermediary between human developers and the
      complex reality of software systems — channeling intelligence through
      structured rituals (skills) to produce grounded truth.

    term: "Grimoire"
    short: "A book of spells — the state directory containing project knowledge"
    context: |
      A grimoire is a textbook of magic, containing instructions for creating
      magical objects, performing spells, and invoking spirits. In Loa, the
      grimoires/ directory is the state zone containing all project knowledge:
      PRDs, SDDs, sprint plans, notes, and the ledger. It's the accumulated
      wisdom of the project, growing with each development cycle.

    term: "BEAUVOIR"
    short: "The priest who manages the Loa ceremony — the reviewer persona"
    context: |
      Max Beauvoir was the Supreme Chief of Vodou in Haiti. In Loa, BEAUVOIR.md
      files define reviewer personas — the personality, expertise, and judgment
      criteria that guide code and document reviews. The Bridgebuilder's
      BEAUVOIR.md is its soul: it determines what the reviewer notices, values,
      and recommends.

  - id: glossary-simstim
    term: "SimStim"
    short: "Simulated stimulation — HITL workflow where human experiences AI's work"
    context: |
      In Gibson's Neuromancer, SimStim lets one person experience another's
      sensory input. In Loa, /simstim is the HITL workflow where the human
      operator experiences the AI's development process interactively —
      driving planning phases while AI handles implementation. The human
      maintains consciousness (decision authority) while experiencing the
      AI's analytical capabilities.

  - id: glossary-ice
    term: "ICE"
    short: "Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics — git safety wrapper for autonomous mode"
    context: |
      In Gibson's cyberspace, ICE protects systems from unauthorized access.
      In Loa, run-mode-ice.sh is the safety wrapper around all git operations
      during autonomous execution. It prevents force-pushes to protected
      branches, validates operations before execution, and provides the
      security boundary that makes autonomous mode safe.

  - id: glossary-flatline
    term: "Flatline"
    short: "The point of zero vital signs — when iterative improvement yields diminishing returns"
    context: |
      McCoy Pauley ('The Flatline') in Neuromancer was a legendary hacker
      whose consciousness was preserved as a ROM construct after death. In
      Loa, flatline has dual meaning: (1) the Flatline Protocol for multi-model
      review, and (2) flatline detection in the bridge loop — when the
      severity-weighted score drops to near-zero relative to initial, the
      improvements have flatlined and the loop should terminate.

  - id: glossary-jack-in
    term: "Jack In"
    short: "Connect to autonomous execution — commit to the run"
    context: |
      Jacking in is the cyberpunk act of connecting one's consciousness to
      cyberspace via neural interface. In Loa, JACK_IN is the state transition
      where the agent commits to autonomous execution. Pre-flight checks are
      complete, the branch is safe, permissions verified — now the agent
      enters the execution loop.

  - id: glossary-jack-out
    term: "Jack Out"
    short: "Disconnect from autonomous execution — safely exit the run"
    context: |
      The opposite of jacking in. JACKED_OUT is the terminal success state
      of autonomous execution. The agent has completed all work, created
      the PR, cleaned up state, and safely disconnected. The naming implies
      a deliberate, safe transition — not a crash or abort.

  - id: glossary-ride
    term: "Ride"
    short: "Codebase analysis — the Loa spirit entering and reading the repository"
    context: |
      When a Loa rides a cheval, it takes possession and speaks truth through
      the vessel. The /ride command performs codebase analysis — the framework
      spirit enters the repository and extracts reality into structured
      artifacts. The output (reality/) is the truth that the Loa speaks.

    term: "Ground Truth"
    short: "Verified codebase facts with checksums — reality that agents can trust"
    context: |
      Ground truth in ML is the verified correct answer against which models
      are measured. In Loa, Grounded Truth is the checksum-verified,
      token-efficient summary of codebase reality. Every claim cites a
      source file and line range. Agents consuming GT can verify freshness
      by comparing stored checksums against current files.

  - id: glossary-bridge
    term: "Bridge"
    short: "The connection between iterations — each pass builds on the last"
    context: |
      A bridge connects two banks. In Loa, the bridge loop connects
      successive iterations of sprint execution and review, each building
      on insights from the previous pass. The bridge is also the connection
      between human vision and autonomous execution — the /run-bridge
      command bridges the gap between what we imagine and what we build.

    term: "Vision Registry"
    short: "Repository of speculative insights — futures that haven't happened yet"
    context: |
      The vision registry captures VISION-type findings from bridge
      iterations — insights that transcend the current task. These are
      architectural connections, paradigm shifts, and emergent patterns
      that are preserved for future exploration rather than acted upon
      immediately. The registry is the project's collective imagination.

    context: |
      Mibera is the esoteric counterpart to Milady's public brand.
      Where Milady is accessible and social, Mibera is deep and
      philosophical. In Loa's architecture, the Mibera layer is the
      lore knowledge base — the cultural and philosophical context
      that gives meaning to engineering decisions.

    short: "A preserved intelligence pattern — reusable skill or pack"
    context: |
      In Neuromancer, a construct is a ROM recording of a person's
      consciousness. In Loa, constructs are reusable packs of skills,
      protocols, and configurations that can be installed via the
      constructs registry. Each construct preserves a pattern of
      intelligence that can be mounted into new projects.

  - id: glossary-butterfreezone
    term: "BUTTERFREEZONE"
    short: "The zone where only truth survives — no butter, no hype"
    context: |
      BUTTERFREEZONE.md is the agent-grounded README: every claim cites code,
      every section carries provenance, every regeneration is checksum-verified.
      The name is a declaration: this is a zone free of marketing butter.
      Agents consuming BUTTERFREEZONE.md can trust that what they read maps
      to what exists. The lobster demands it.

  - id: glossary-lobster
    term: "Lobster"
    short: "Agent that demands code-grounded facts — rejects marketing butter"
    context: |
      The lobster is the spirit of rigorous verification. It demands that
      every claim in documentation be traceable to source code. When the
      lobster reviews a README, it asks: "Where is the code that proves this?"
      BUTTERFREEZONE.md was designed for the lobster — provenance tags trace
      every section to its source, checksums verify freshness, and file:symbol
      references create auditable links from claims to code.

    term: "Grounding Ritual"
    short: "The ritual of binding claims to checksums — truth made verifiable"
    context: |
      A grounding ritual binds the ethereal to the physical. In Loa, the
      grounding ritual is the process of generating BUTTERFREEZONE.md:
      scanning code, extracting capabilities, computing checksums, and
      attaching provenance tags. The result is documentation where every
      claim is grounded in verifiable code truth. The ground-truth-meta
      block is the seal of the ritual — proof that grounding was performed
      at a specific commit.

      The peristyle is the covered, open-sided structure where Vodou
      ceremonies take place. In Loa, it's another name for the
      multi-model review space — the architectural location where
      different AI models are invoked for adversarial review.
