# Update

## Purpose

Pull the latest Loa framework updates from the upstream repository. Safely fetches, previews changes, and merges with guidance for conflict resolution.

## Invocation

```
/update
```

## Prerequisites

- Working tree must be clean (no uncommitted changes)
- `loa` or `upstream` remote must be configured

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

1. Verify working tree is clean
2. Verify upstream remote exists

### Phase 2: Fetch Updates

```bash
git fetch loa main
```

### Phase 3: Show Changes

- Count new commits
- Display commit list
- Show files that will change

### Phase 4: Confirm Update

Ask for confirmation before merging. Note which files will be updated vs preserved.

### Phase 5: Merge Updates

```bash
git merge loa/main -m "chore: update Loa framework"
```

### Phase 6: Handle Merge Result

- **Success**: Show changelog excerpt and next steps
- **Conflicts**: List conflicted files with resolution guidance

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| None | | |

## Outputs

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Git merge commit | Merged upstream changes |

## Merge Strategy

| File Location | Merge Behavior |
|---------------|----------------|
| `.claude/skills/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `.claude/commands/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `.claude/protocols/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `.claude/scripts/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Standard merge (may conflict) |
| `PROCESS.md` | Standard merge (may conflict) |
| `app/` | Preserved (your code) |
| `grimoires/loa/prd.md` | Preserved (your docs) |
| `grimoires/loa/sdd.md` | Preserved (your docs) |
| `grimoires/loa/analytics/` | Preserved (your data) |
| `.loa-setup-complete` | Preserved (your setup state) |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Preserved (your project changelog) |
| `README.md` | Preserved (your project readme) |

## Conflict Resolution

### Framework Files (`.claude/`)

Recommend accepting upstream version:
```bash
git checkout --theirs {filename}
```

### Project Identity Files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`)

These files define YOUR project, not the Loa framework. ALWAYS keep your version:
```bash
git checkout --ours CHANGELOG.md README.md
```

Never accept upstream versions of these files - they contain Loa's template content, not your project's history and documentation.

### Project Files

Manual resolution required:
1. Open file and find conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`)
2. Keep changes you want from both versions
3. Remove conflict markers
4. Save the file

### After Resolving

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: update Loa framework (conflicts resolved)"
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| "Uncommitted changes" | Dirty working tree | Commit or stash changes first |
| "Remote not configured" | Missing loa/upstream remote | Add remote with `git remote add` |
| "Fetch failed" | Network or auth error | Check connection and remote URL |
| "Already up to date" | No new commits | Nothing to update |

## Next Steps After Update

- Review [Loa releases](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/releases) for new features and changes
- Check `CLAUDE.md` for new commands or workflow updates
- Run `/setup` if prompted by new setup requirements
