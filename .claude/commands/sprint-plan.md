# Sprint Plan

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive sprint plan based on PRD and SDD. Breaks down work into actionable tasks with acceptance criteria, priorities, and assignments.

## Invocation

```
/sprint-plan
/sprint-plan background
```

## Agent

Launches `planning-sprints` from `skills/planning-sprints/`.

See: `skills/planning-sprints/SKILL.md` for full workflow details.

## Prerequisites

- Setup completed (`.loa-setup-complete` exists)
- PRD created (`grimoires/loa/prd.md` exists)
- SDD created (`grimoires/loa/sdd.md` exists)

## Workflow

1. **Pre-flight**: Verify setup, PRD, and SDD exist
2. **Analysis**: Read PRD for requirements, SDD for architecture
3. **Breakdown**: Create sprint structure with actionable tasks
4. **Clarification**: Ask about team size, sprint duration, priorities
5. **Validation**: Confirm assumptions about capacity and scope
6. **Generation**: Create sprint plan at `grimoires/loa/sprint.md`
7. **Analytics**: Update usage metrics (THJ users only)

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `background` | Run as subagent for parallel execution | No |

## Outputs

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `grimoires/loa/sprint.md` | Sprint plan with tasks |

## Sprint Plan Sections

The generated plan includes:
- Sprint Overview (goals, duration, team structure)
- Sprint Breakdown with:
  - Sprint number and goals
  - Tasks with clear descriptions
  - Acceptance criteria (specific, measurable)
  - Estimated effort/complexity
  - Developer assignments
  - Dependencies and prerequisites
  - Testing requirements
- MVP Definition and scope
- Feature prioritization rationale
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Success metrics per sprint
- Dependencies and blockers
- Buffer time for unknowns

## Task Format

Each task includes:
- Task ID and title
- Detailed description
- Acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort
- Assigned to
- Dependencies
- Testing requirements

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| "Loa setup has not been completed" | Missing `.loa-setup-complete` | Run `/setup` first |
| "PRD not found" | Missing prd.md | Run `/plan-and-analyze` first |
| "SDD not found" | Missing sdd.md | Run `/architect` first |

## Planner Style

The planner will:
- Ask about team capacity and sprint duration
- Clarify MVP scope and feature priorities
- Present options for sequencing and dependencies
- Only generate plan when confident in breakdown

## Next Step

After sprint plan is complete:
```
/implement sprint-1
```

That's it. The implement command handles everything:
- If Beads is installed: Automatically manages task lifecycle (bd ready, update, close)
- If Beads is not installed: Uses markdown-based tracking from sprint.md

**No manual `bd` commands required.** The agent handles task state internally.
