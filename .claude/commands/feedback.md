3. **Rate this build vs other approaches** (1-5 scale)
4. **How comfortable was the process?** (A-E multiple choice)

### Phase 2: Prepare Submission

- Load analytics from `grimoires/loa/analytics/usage.json`
- Gather project context (name, developer info)
- Save pending feedback as safety backup

### Phase 3: Linear Submission
