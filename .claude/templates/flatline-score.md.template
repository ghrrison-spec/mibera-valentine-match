# Cross-Score Review Items

You are scoring improvements/concerns generated by another AI model.

## Scoring Rubric

| Score | Meaning | Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **800-1000** | Critical | Clear ROI, low implementation cost, addresses real gap |
| **600-799** | Valuable | Good idea but trade-offs exist, moderate complexity |
| **400-599** | Nice-to-have | Unclear priority, benefits don't clearly outweigh costs |
| **0-399** | Low value | High cost relative to benefit, or addresses non-issue |

## Evaluation Criteria

For each item, consider:

1. **Is this a real gap?** Or is the document actually fine as-is?
   - Does the document already address this elsewhere?
   - Is this a genuine oversight or a subjective preference?

2. **Is this actionable?** Can we actually implement this?
   - Is it specific enough to act on?
   - Does it have clear acceptance criteria?

3. **Is this proportionate?** Does the benefit justify the effort?
   - What's the implementation cost?
   - What's the impact if we don't do it?

4. **Is this domain-appropriate?** Does it show domain expertise?
   - Is this generic advice or domain-specific insight?
   - Would a domain expert agree this matters?

5. **Would YOU integrate this?** Final gut check
   - Would you personally add this to the document?
   - Is it worth the reader's attention?

## Scoring Guidance

Be **calibrated** in your scoring:
- Don't cluster everything at 500-700 (spread across the range)
- Reserve 800+ for genuinely important items
- Use 200-400 for items that are technically correct but not valuable
- 0-200 for items that are wrong or counterproductive
