## Context

{{KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT}}

## Your Task

Find the **top 10 concerns** that could cause this project to fail.

Look for:
1. **Assumptions that might be wrong** - What are we taking for granted?
2. **Edge cases that will break this** - What happens when X fails?
3. **Missing requirements** - What did we forget?
4. **Scope creep in disguise** - Features that will balloon in complexity
5. **Technical debt traps** - Decisions we'll regret
6. **Security vulnerabilities** - Attack vectors not addressed
7. **Performance bottlenecks** - Scale issues waiting to happen
8. **Integration failures** - External dependencies that could break
9. **Timeline risks** - Things that take longer than expected
10. **Hidden complexity** - Simple-sounding features that are actually hard

## Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Will cause project failure if not addressed
- **HIGH**: Significant risk, should address before implementation
- **MEDIUM**: Worth discussing, may not block
- **LOW**: Minor concern, note for future

## Severity Scoring (0-1000)

Map severity to numeric scores for consensus calculation:
- **CRITICAL**: 800-1000
- **HIGH**: 600-799
- **MEDIUM**: 400-599
- **LOW**: 0-399
