# {{PHASE}} Review - Improvement Focus

You are reviewing a {{PHASE_FULL}} to identify improvements that would make it better.

## Context

{{KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT}}

## Your Task

Generate the **top 10 improvements** for this document.

For each improvement:
1. **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., IMP-001)
2. **Description**: Clear, actionable improvement
3. **Rationale**: Why this matters
4. **Location**: Section or requirement affected
5. **Priority**: HIGH (critical), MEDIUM (valuable), LOW (nice-to-have)

## Scoring Criteria

Think about whether another expert model would agree:
- Would they score this >700? Then it's a strong improvement.
- Would they score this <400? Then it might be noise.
- Is this domain-specific expertise, or generic advice?

Focus on:
- **Missing requirements** that are essential for success
- **Ambiguous specifications** that need clarification
- **Security or performance gaps** that could cause issues
- **Edge cases** not addressed
- **Integration points** that need definition

Avoid:
- Generic advice that applies to any document
- Stylistic preferences without functional impact
- Improvements that duplicate existing content
- Scope expansion beyond the stated goals
